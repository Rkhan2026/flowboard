/**
 * middleware.ts - Handles route protection and onboarding redirects
 *
 * What this does:
 * - Blocks access to certain routes if you're not signed in
 * - Redirects signed-in users to onboarding if they haven't picked an organization yet
 *
 * This runs automatically for matched routes before the actual page or API loads.
